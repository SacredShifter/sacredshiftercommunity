## Part 1: Hermetic Principles

This section covers the seven interactive scenes that teach the Hermetic Principles.

### 1. Principle of Mentalism (`Mentalism.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: Visualizes the principle "The All is Mind" with a particle lattice that moves from chaotic to stable as "Intent Coherence" increases. An input for a "thought" is provided as a focusing aid.
*   **Production Compliance**: **Performance Issue.** The per-particle animation is calculated on the CPU every frame, which is inefficient and will cause performance problems on many devices.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Critical Performance Optimization**: The particle animation logic **must** be moved from the CPU to the GPU by implementing it in a custom shader. This is the highest priority fix.
    2.  **Integrate "Thought" Input**: Connect the text input to the visualization. For example, the length or sentiment of the thought could influence the color or stability of the lattice.
    3.  **Visual Polish**: Add glow or size attenuation to the particles to make the visualization more aesthetically pleasing.
    4.  **Educational Context**: Add more text to explain the principle in greater detail.

### 2. Principle of Correspondence (`Correspondence.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: A camera travels along a curve through different scales of the universe (from carbon to galaxies) to demonstrate "As above, so below." A slider controls the user's progress.
*   **Production Compliance**: The component is simple and performs well.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Implement Toggle Buttons**: The "Toggle Phi" and "Toggle Branching Angle" buttons are currently non-functional. They should be implemented to overlay these geometric patterns on the scene.
    2.  **Enhance Visuals**: The stages are currently simple spheres. They should be replaced with more detailed 3D models (e.g., a carbon lattice model, a leaf model, a galaxy model).
    3.  **Add Educational Content**: Provide more detailed information about each stage as the user reaches it.

### 3. Principle of Vibration (`Vibration.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: Links an audible sine wave (Web Audio API) to a visual particle field. An "amplitude" slider controls both the volume and the intensity of the visual vibration.
*   **Production Compliance**: **Performance Issue.** Similar to the Mentalism module, this component uses CPU-based per-particle animation, which is inefficient.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Critical Performance Optimization**: The particle animation logic **must** be moved to a GPU shader.
    2.  **Visualize Frequency**: The "frequency" slider currently only affects the audio. It should also be passed to the shader to control the spatial frequency (the "waviness") of the particle field.
    3.  **Optimize Audio Context**: The `AudioContext` is recreated on every slider change. It should be created only once on mount, with its properties updated in `useEffect`.
    4.  **Enhance Visual Feedback**: Color the particles based on their displacement or velocity to make the wave patterns more visible.

### 4. Principle of Polarity (`Polarity.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: A central object switches between two different geometries and materials (a "Yin" torus and a "Yang" icosahedron) based on a slider value, demonstrating duality on a continuum.
*   **Production Compliance**: The component is lightweight and performs well.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Implement Smooth Transitions**: The primary enhancement is to replace the abrupt switch between geometries with a smooth transition using shaders or morph targets. This would provide a more accurate visualization of a continuum.
    2.  **Synchronize Visuals with Labels**: The UI has three labels (Ice, Water, Vapor), but the 3D object only has two forms. The visualization should be updated to have three corresponding visual states.
    3.  **Add Thematic Visual Effects**: Enhance the states with thematic effects (e.g., a crystalline shader for "Ice," a refractive, liquid look for "Water").

### 5. Principle of Rhythm (`Rhythm.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: Visualizes rhythm using a swinging pendulum and a day-night light cycle, both driven by smooth sine wave animations.
*   **Production Compliance**: The component is highly performant.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Add User Interaction**: Allow users to "push" the pendulum by clicking and dragging it to provide a more hands-on experience.
    2.  **Visualize Compensation**: Add UI elements to display the peak angle on both the left and right swings to visually confirm that the "measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left."
    3.  **Add Rhythmic Audio**: A subtle ticking sound for the pendulum would greatly enhance immersion.

### 6. Principle of Cause & Effect (`CauseEffect.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: An interactive Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where clicking a node activates it and all of its descendants, clearly demonstrating the chain of causality.
*   **Production Compliance**: The component is performant and the logic is sound.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Visual Feedback**: Enhance the node activation with more dynamic visual effects, such as a particle burst or a glowing energy pulse that travels along the edges to the child nodes.
    2.  **Complex Scenarios**: Add buttons to load different, more complex graph structures to demonstrate more intricate causal relationships.
    3.  **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Add the ability to undo or reset the activations to allow for easier experimentation.

### 7. Principle of Gender (`Gender.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: Two interacting toruses represent masculine ("Will") and feminine ("Receptivity") energies. A central "creation" object grows in size as the two energies approach balance, effectively visualizing the creative power of coherence.
*   **Production Compliance**: The component is performant and well-implemented.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Dynamic "Creation" Object**: Instead of just scaling, have the "Creation" object change in geometric complexity or material richness based on the coherence level.
    2.  **Contextual Explanations**: Add dynamic text that explains what is happening as the user interacts with the sliders to reinforce the learning.
    3.  **Refactor State**: The `coherence` value is calculated in two different places. It should be calculated once in the parent component and passed down as a prop.

## Part 2: 3D Learning Modules

This section covers the more complex, multi-faceted 3D learning applications.

### 1. Breath of Source 3D (`BreathOfSource3D.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: A highly modular and feature-rich guided breathing module. It orchestrates a 3D scene, UI, audio, and lesson progression. The progressive unlocking of features based on lesson completion is excellent.
*   **Production Compliance**: Built with performance in mind (e.g., `Suspense`, shaders). The main performance dependency is on its child components, which require their own analysis.
*   **Validation Checks**: An `<ErrorBoundary>` is used to catch runtime errors.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Unify State Management**: Consolidate the component's state (currently split between local `useState` and a custom hook) into a single source of truth like a dedicated state machine (XState/Zustand) or by expanding the existing `useBreathOfSourceModule` hook.
    2.  **Fix Background Animation**: The `uTime` uniform in the `SacredBackground` shader is declared but not updated. It should be updated in a `useFrame` loop to enable the background animation.
    3.  **Robust `useEffect` Handling**: The `useEffect` that manages the breathing state needs a proper cleanup function to explicitly stop the animation when the user navigates away from a relevant lesson.
    4.  **Comprehensive Accessibility Audit**: A full accessibility review of the numerous UI elements is needed.

### 2. Chakra Learning 3D (`ChakraLearning3D.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: A polished and informative interactive explorer for the chakra system. It uses a clean, data-driven approach to generate the 3D scene and the detailed UI panels.
*   **Production Compliance**: The scene is performant due to its low polygon count.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Animate the Energy Flow**: The static `EnergyFlow` particles should be animated to flow up the central spinal column to create a more dynamic and representative scene.
    2.  **Add Audio Feedback**: When a chakra is selected, play its associated frequency using the Web Audio API to create a multi-sensory experience.
    3.  **Externalize Chakra Data**: The `chakraData` array should be moved from the component file into a separate data file (e.g., `src/data/chakraData.ts`) for better code organization.
    4.  **Implement a Guided Tour**: Add a "tour" mode that automatically guides the user through each chakra, which would be valuable for new users.

### 3. Energy Literacy 3D (`EnergyLiteracy3D.tsx`)

*   **Implementation Verification**: An innovative, gamified tool that teaches energy management via a four-step cycle (`scan`, `identify`, `correct`, `recheck`). The 3D `EnergyField` provides excellent, immediate visual feedback on the user's state.
*   **Production Compliance**: The component is well-performant due to its simple 3D geometry.
*   **Validation Checks**: No automated validation checks are present.
*   **Recommended Enhancements**:
    1.  **Animate 3D Interactions**: Animate the "drain" and "restoration" events. For example, have "drains" visually latch onto the energy field and have "restoration" particles flow into it.
    2.  **Incorporate Sound Design**: Add sound effects for key events: a humming sound for the energy field, a "leeching" sound for drains, and a "charging" sound for restorations.
    3.  **Data Persistence**: Use `localStorage` to save the user's state, allowing them to track their common energy drains and effective restoration methods over time.
    4.  **Extract State Logic**: Move the game logic from the component into a dedicated custom hook (e.g., `useEnergyLiteracy`) to improve code structure and reusability.
